[Full app description + other versions](https://github.com/PhieF/CarnetDocumentation)


Please don't send bug report, this is still an early version.


Requires https://github.com/PhieF/CarnetElectron 

Build instructions will soon be available.


## Goals

1. Implementing all backend API to get rid of the electron version on linux and having a fully working version of Carnet inside GTK webkit

2. Integrating some ui element in gnome environment. Make use of CSD Gnome headerbar (done) + adapt webview css to color of the theme (on its way)

3. First Carnet window should be only GTK, no HTML
